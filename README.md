It will be used as an incentive for holders, purchasers, and validators in an educational based scholarly project that offers one of a kind NFTs. These NFTs will grab the interest of science enthusiast all around the world. 

The simple tokenomics of 5% reflection and 2% burn fees with every transaction creates a token where holders not only benefit from the incentives AST provides in its ecosystem but also through passive accumulation of AST. AST can be distributed by our users as they deem fit but each transaction is subject to the 7% fee (5% reflection/2% burn).
